working in /gpfs/home/asun/jin_lab/perturbench/studies/perturbench/0_datasets/splitter_test, both run_latent.sh and run_state.sh. Testing to see if there is a way to submit everything as an sbatch script. 

submitting / requesting on multiple nodes, wrote a script to check if all nodes are compatible with the options selected.
